<!-- There are load of things I have learnt in the past 2 months in taking this course, and I will say this learning has shaped my mindset, my outlook on seeing things from a holistic point and not just personal point. I am engineer and I need to know that what I build individually or collaboratively often times is not just for the ease of my life but for the entire human kind and I need to be empathetic about these decisions and also inclusive. They are different things that must be considered.  most tim learning

This one I beleive i accept fully and I have already incorporated in my life in the past 3 weeks and it has been helpful, made me more transparent.
Before now I use to think accepting or jumping on any task is something to be proud about but after taking the first few classes especially the lecture where we were taught about uncertainty - Normative uncertainty the different types where we learnt about the Epistemic uncertainty. "What do we know?"" First the dictionary meaning of Epistemic is relating to knowledge and Epistemicology is the study of knowledge acquisition. I normally would accept project that I am not currently competent at but with the hope that I would grasp the knowledge or find someone that knows a lot about the subject topic and might be able to put me through. But only looking at the bigger picture if project owner was to ask me about the expected delivery I always come up with vague delivery date this create a lot of uncertainty for me "project owner is not aware I am not competent" they just assume the project will be done at the delivery time and not consiwer the uncertainty of my not delivery. "Uncertainty in decision making is not nece"

Where did i learn this?
I learnt from my environemtn I often see my brother colect project he wasn't competent/well skilled at but hewill end up collecting it and delivering this proiject but not art rthe required time. He was only concerned avbout delivery the project and not

 and  But on knowiung the RULE 2 of APEGA "professional engineers and geoscientists shall undertake only work that they are compet3ent to perform by the virtue of their trainign and experience. themselves with integrity, honesty, fairness and objectivity in their professional activities"

 Challanged my thinking?

 Every bone and fiber in me still thinks accepting this project since you have the intention in perfoming them in still morally right. The quetion when do we decide cross road of accepting a poroject. Scenerio, I have been trained to write a software but I have never written a production based projeect =. Do i accept this request or do i tell my employer that I am capable or I just tell them i am can'tbecause I have not been trained to wrtite this large codebase. It is a grtay area and I beleive most employers opnky want to employee people that will challange themselve. As yo can see this crates a big convern. -->

 "Throughout this course, I've gained numerous insights that have reshaped my perspective on engineering ethics. The most surprising and interesting aspect I learned was the concept of holistic thinking in engineering decisions, particularly considering the broader impact on humanity rather than just personal or immediate benefits.
One of the most impactful learnings was about uncertainty in decision-making, especially the concept of Epistemic uncertainty. This challenged my previous approach of accepting tasks without fully acknowledging my competence level. I've learned the importance of transparency regarding my skills and the potential uncertainties in project delivery.
To extend my learning beyond the classroom, I've been actively applying these principles in my life over the past three weeks. For instance, I'm now more transparent about my capabilities when approached with new tasks, which aligns with APEGA's Rule 2 about undertaking only work that one is competent to perform.
The concept that challenged my thinking the most was the ethical dilemma of accepting projects that stretch beyond one's current competencies. While I understand the importance of only undertaking work I'm competent in, I still grapple with the idea that accepting challenging projects with the intention to learn and grow might be morally justifiable. This creates a gray area, especially in scenarios where I have the foundational skills but lack specific experience, such as writing production-level software for the first time.
This ethical consideration has led me to reflect deeply on the balance between professional growth and ethical responsibility. It's challenged me to think more critically about how to approach opportunities for professional development while maintaining integrity and honesty about my current capabilities.
In conclusion, this course has not only provided me with ethical guidelines but has also prompted me to critically examine my professional decisions and their potential impacts. It's reinforced the importance of continuous learning and self-assessment in the engineering profession."
