- One impactful learnings was about uncertainty in decision-making, especially the concept of Epistemic uncertainty. This challenged my previous approach of accepting tasks without fully acknowledging my competence level.
- I've learned the importance of transparency regarding my skills and the potential uncertainties in project delivery.
- I've been actively applying these principles in my life over the past three weeks.
- The concept that challenged my thinking is dilemma of accepting projects that stretch beyond my current competencies.
- While I understand the importance of only undertaking work I'm competent in, I still grapple with the idea that accepting challenging projects with the intention to learn and grow might be morally justifiable.

<!-- - For instance, I'm now more transparent about my capabilities when approached with new tasks, which aligns with APEGA's Rule 2 about undertaking only work that one is competent to perform. -->
<!-- - This creates a gray area, especially in scenarios where I have the foundational skills but lack specific experience, such as writing production-level software for the first time. -->
<!-- This ethical consideration has led me to reflect deeply on the balance between professional growth and ethical responsibility. It's challenged me to think more critically about how to approach opportunities for professional development while maintaining integrity and honesty about my current capabilities.
In conclusion, this course has not only provided me with ethical guidelines but has also prompted me to critically examine my professional decisions and their potential impacts. It's reinforced the importance of continuous learning and self-assessment in the engineering profession." -->
