<!-- What was your one biggest takeaway from the project process and
teamwork? How would you summarize what you learned about
teamwork and/or project management? What was surprising?
What was the hardest part of the process? What was the most
rewarding part of the process? 

One thing I learnt here working with my team members is that we all approach problems different, even tho we all want the same result our approaches at achieving this can be different, and we also need to be open minded and listen to people. Don't feel that your approach is the best. Listen, Listen, Listen. I also learnt that it is best to have one person who will act like an accountability manager within the group. FOllowng up on every one works. I took that art in my group. What was surprising is that some people who you think are not very vocal in the group would not contribute. This ended being a surprise for me because the person with the least/ or no option always delivered their work first. So don't no tbe quick to judge because you don't kno wepeoples background.   I ended up finding out that they reason he wasn't vocal lwas because english is not is first language. Hardes part in the process is trying to ensure we are all availble to discuss how we were going to solve our assignment together, because we all have differtnt schedule it was difficult to agree on a suitable time for everyone, some of us had to compromise on the time. The most rewarding is after all these seeing that we all get good grades in all the assignment. After the all well and good and out grades come out we get to score good. -->

<!-- Overcoming Preconceptions: Initial impressions of team members' capabilities can be misleading.
Surprising Aspects
The most surprising aspect was discovering that the quietest team member was often the first to complete their tasks. This experience taught me not to judge team members' capabilities based on their verbal participation alone. I learned that factors like language barriers can influence a person's communication style without affecting their work quality or commitment.
Hardest Part of the Process -->
<!-- - The most challenging aspect was coordinating schedules for team discussions. With diverse schedules and commitments, finding a time that suited everyone required compromise and flexibility from all team members.
- The most satisfying aspect of the project was seeing our collective efforts result in good grades for all assignments. This outcome validated our teamwork and individual contributions, demonstrating that despite challenges, we could achieve success through collaboration.
