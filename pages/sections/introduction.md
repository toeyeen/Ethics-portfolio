My name is <span v-mark="{ color: '#fcb331', type: 'underline' }"> Oluwatoyin Jolaoso</span>, and I am a graduate student in the Geomatics department at the University of Calgary. As an engineer, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions for everyday problems. I find great joy in breaking down complex issues into manageable parts, allowing me to see the bigger picture and develop effective solutions.Professionally, I have experience as a software engineer and an account manager. In this field it has made it easy to bring my ideas into realization faster.
A notable success in my career has been successfully transitioning into the tech industry. Initially daunting, this journey taught me resilience and adaptability. As I often say in Pidgin English, 'everybody go dey alright las las'â€”meaning that things may seem uncertain at first, but they will work out in the end.
