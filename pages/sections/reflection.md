        This reflection emphasize the impact of Dr. Robyn's lecture on the wellness wheel. The inclusion of this
        concept in our course has had a profound effect on my personal development. In the weeks following this
        reflection, I've noticed unconscious improvements not only in my financial wellness but also in my physical
        well-being. This shows the power of awareness and intentional goal-setting in promoting personal growth.
