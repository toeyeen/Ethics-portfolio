# Reflection and looking back

<!-- Throughout the semester you completed many reflections through
dropbox quiz submissions. Go to D2L and review your reflections
and reflect on your journey as a learner through the semester. For
these two entries, write anything that comes to mind when you
read your previous responses (it can be big picture or reflecting
back on a specific response). These portfolio entries must include
clear quotes from your previous reflections, without these quotes
dominating the text of the portfolio entry

During the Reflection Quiz 5 I mentioned that "One small goal I could set for myself in the next week to bring a little balance to my wellness wheel is to dedicate some time to improving my financial wellness". Looking back at this statememt I am super grateful for the lecturer Dr Robyn for taking her time to include this wellness wheel in our lecture. I have been able to unconsiouly improve om my financial wellness and also my physcial wellness in the last couple of weeks just because of this lecture.

During the Design for justice reflection quiz 8, I mentioned that "designing a public building, gathering input from the community that would benefit from this can lead to more functional and accepted design". Looking back at this statement I can of have a slightky different believe system now, while this is an important step I also don't believe this a sole reason for success. I thought this was enough when I said that during the lecture but it is important to know that because someine is impacted by or is a user of something doesn't not necessarily make them the best person to advice on the subject matter, in fact they are professionals/ of people that masters in that and will he in the best position to advice. Just because I am a train user doesn't mean I can give the besst advioce how to build a train. I felt this is thought proviking and needs a rethinkn

Your reflections on your previous quiz responses show thoughtful consideration of your learning journey throughout the semester. Let's structure these insights into a more formal portfolio entry: -->
During the Design for Justice reflection in Quiz 8, I wrote:  

> "Designing a public building, gathering input from the community that would benefit from this can lead to more functional and accepted design."

Upon revisiting this statement, I've realized that my perspective has evolved. While community input remains crucial, I now recognize that it's not the sole factor in successful design. This reflection has prompted me to consider the complexity of design processes more deeply.

I've come to understand that while user input is valuable, it must be balanced with professional expertise. For instance, being a frequent train user doesn't necessarily qualify someone to provide the best advice on train design or construction. This realization underscores the importance of integrating diverse perspectives – both from users and experts – in ethical engineering practices.

In Reflection Quiz 5, I stated:

> "One small goal I could set for myself in the next week to bring a little balance to my wellness wheel is to dedicate some time to improving my financial wellness."

This reflection highlights the impact of Dr. Robyn's lecture on the wellness wheel. The inclusion of this concept in our course has had a profound effect on my personal development. In the weeks following this reflection, I've noticed unconscious improvements not only in my financial wellness but also in my physical well-being. This demonstrates the power of awareness and intentional goal-setting in promoting holistic personal growth.
