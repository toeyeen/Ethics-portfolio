        Designing a public building, gathering input from the community that would benefit from this can lead to more
        functional and accepted design.

        <!-- Upon revisiting this statement, I've realized that my perspective has evolved. While community input remains

        I now recognize that it's not the sole factor in successful design. This reflection has prompted me to consider the complexity of design processes more deeply.
        I've come to understand that while user input is valuable, it must be balanced with professional expertise. For example, being a frequent train user doesn't necessarily qualify someone to provide the best advice on train
        design or construction.
