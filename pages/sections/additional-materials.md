  1. The Ford-Firestone tire case shows how important safety is in engineering. This focuses on how the importance of small design choices, like tire pressure recommendations, can lead to tragic outcomes when safety is not taken seriously.

  Engineers have a moral duty to rigorously test their products, especially when people's lives are involved in the use process. What is also surprising is how both Ford and Firestone initially tried to shift the blame onto each other, which highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the industry clearly, where both company employees failed in APEGA rule 3 which states that engineers shall be honest and fair in their professional activities.

  The final takeaway is for engineers to put safety first and understand the serious implications of cost reduction. It is mportance to maintain strong quality control practices throughout a product's life cycle.
