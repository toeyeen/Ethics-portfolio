- Facebook conducted a psychological experiment on nearly 700,000 users without their explicit consent.
- The study manipulated users' news feeds to show more positive or negative content to see how it affected their own posts.
- This raised significant ethical concerns about informed consent in digital research and the potential psychological impact on unwitting participants.
- This case study highlights critical ethical issues in engineering and technology design, particularly regarding user safety and consent.

<!-- - The incident raises questions about the boundaries of ethical research in the digital age and the responsibility of tech companies to their users. It challenges us to consider how we can balance the pursuit of knowledge and innovation with the need to protect user privacy and autonomy. As future engineers, we must be vigilant about incorporating ethical considerations into our design processes, especially when our work can influence people's emotions or behaviors.
This case also shows the importance of transparency and informed consent in technological research and development. -->

 <!-- It prompts us to reflect on how we can design systems that respect user agency and provide clear information about how user data is being used or manipulated.
In the context of engineering ethics, this incident serves as a cautionary tale about the potential misuse of technology and data. It emphasizes the need for robust ethical frameworks in tech companies and research institutions, and the importance of fostering a culture of ethical responsibility among engineers and designers. -->

<!-- As engineers, we have a responsibility to consider the potential consequences of our designs and experiments on users' wellbeing. The Facebook study demonstrates how even seemingly minor manipulations of user experiences can have far-reaching ethical implications. -->
