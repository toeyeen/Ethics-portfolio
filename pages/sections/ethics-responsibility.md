<!-- - Taking ENGG 687 has significantly broadened my understanding of ethics, particularly in the context of engineering. -->

<v-clicks depths="1">

- Prior to this course, I had a general grasp of ethics, but I now appreciate the nuances and specific applications within the engineering profession.
- My biggest takeaway from ENGG 687 has been the importance of considering ethical implications in engineering design, especially the concepts of 'design for ethics' and 'design for equity'.
- I've learned to differentiate between equality and equity, understanding that equitable solutions often require tailored approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.
- When approaching design challenges, I'll consider not just the technical aspects but also the ethical implications and how to ensure equitable outcomes.

<!-- I'll strive to maintain awareness of the broader societal impacts of engineering work, considering diverse perspectives and needs. -->
<!-- For instance, in resource distribution, equity means allocating based on need rather than equally dividing resources. -->
<!-- As I move forward in my career, I plan to integrate these learnings in several ways:
I will keep the APEGA principles at the forefront of my practice, using them as a guide for ethical decision-making.

<!-- - In team settings, I'll advocate for ethical considerations to be part of our standard process, encouraging discussions about the ethical dimensions of our projects.
I commit to ongoing learning and reflection on ethical issues in engineering, recognizing that ethical challenges evolve with technological advancements. -->
<!-- This course has instilled in me a deeper sense of professional responsibility. I now see that as engineers, we have a duty not just to create functional solutions, but to ensure those solutions are ethically sound and contribute positively to society. This perspective will be integral to my approach to engineering throughout my career." -->
