          - Taking ENGG 687 has broadened my understanding of ethics. Prior to this course, I had a general grasp of
          ethics, but I now appreciate the nuances and specific applications within the engineering profession.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My biggest takeaway from ENGG 687 has been the importance of considering ethical implications in engineering
        design, especially the concepts of 'design for ethics' and 'design for equity'.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've learned to differentiate between equality and equity, understanding that equitable solutions often require
        tailored approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions. For instance, in resource distribution, equity
        means allocating based on need rather than equally dividing resources.
      </li>
      <li>In team settings, I'll advocate for ethical considerations to be part of our standard process, encouraging
        discussions about the ethical dimensions of our projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        I commit to ongoing learning and reflection on ethical issues in engineering, recognizing that ethical
        challenges evolve with technological advancements.
